# J.A.T.E Text Editor
------------------------------------------------
## Description

Our task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation

To build the J.A.T.E Text Editor, you will need to clone the repo and run the following commands in the Terminal:

```
1. npm install - To install dependencies

4. then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
```
