# J.A.T.E Text Editor
------------------------------------------------
## Description

Our task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

```
1. npm install - To install dependencies
